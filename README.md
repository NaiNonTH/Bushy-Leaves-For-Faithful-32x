# Description

As the title suggests, Bushy Leaves for Faithful 32x is a resource pack project that adds bushy leaves textures and models to the game to use with the Faithful 32x resource pack.

## MUST-READ
To properly use this resource pack, please follow these instructions:
1. **MAKE SURE THAT THE GRAPHICS OPTION IS SET TO FANCY.**
2. If you're using OptiFine, you should set the Tree option to __**SMART**__ for a better FPS.
3. Alternatively, you also can use Cull Leaves mod, Cull Less Leaves mod or MoreCulling Mod for a better FPS.
4. This resource pack works with 1.14 up to 1.19. Just ignore the warning; it will be fine. (Should also be working with related snapshots)
